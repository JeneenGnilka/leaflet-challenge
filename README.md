# Create the Earthquake Visualization

Downloaded starter files

Get dataset. To do so, follow these steps:

  The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visited the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site.
  page and chose a dataset to visualize.

Click a dataset ("All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days") and was given a JSON representation of that data. Used the URL of 
this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:

  Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

    The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
    Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

  Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

  Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
